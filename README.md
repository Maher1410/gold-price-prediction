## Introduction
Gold prices are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Predicting these prices accurately can be valuable for investors and financial analysts. This project utilizes machine learning to forecast gold prices based on historical trends and relevant features.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**: Run the `gold_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook to train the Random Forest Regressor model using historical data.
2. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as R-squared error.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict gold prices based on user input. Execute the prediction function and provide the required features.

## Evaluation
The trained Random Forest Regressor model achieves a high R-squared error, indicating strong correlation between predicted and actual gold prices. Various visualization techniques, such as plots comparing actual vs. predicted values, provide insights into model performance.
